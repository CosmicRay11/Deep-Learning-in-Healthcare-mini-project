# Deep Learning in Healthcare mini-project

Code and report for Deep Learning in Healthcare mini-project, submitted to University of Oxford over Easter Vacation 2023.

The project task was to develop a deep learning model to extract volumetric measures from the brain, propose and conduct experiments based on an adult brain MRI dataset and report the findings. I investigated the question: "How do data augmentation and autoencoder regularisation interact on 3D subcortical brain segmentation tasks?"

To investigate this question I performed ablation studies on the Segresnet-VAE model first proposed by Myronenko (https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11654).
